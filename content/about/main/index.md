  This is a place where I want to share my current interests and my recent work on water related issues. I have already a wordpress site and blog but I am planning to start something new at this place, where I have more control over everything. 
  
  I intend to share my lastest thoughts and research initiatives in the blog section, but I also want a place where I can store my talks and selected publications, and display my current and former students' work, so perspective students can have an idea of how my research interests have been changing over time. 
  
  I also plan on having a section showing tha current position of former students.I believe this can be helpful for perspective students.
